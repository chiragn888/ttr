Sure, I can help with that. However, it seems like the instructions provided are not related to making changes to the code. It looks like you want to change the directory to 'up-work-portal' and then start the 'index.html' file. This is not related to modifying code within a file.

If you require assistance with making changes to code within a specific file, please provide the details about the changes you'd like to make, and I would be happy to help.
