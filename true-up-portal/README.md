As a meticulous engineer, I will follow the plan of action to create the README.md file in the "true-up-portal" directory. I will include detailed descriptions of the project's purpose, the functionalities it offers, and a brief overview of each page (index, trending, login, company rankings, job posting, job listing, profile). I will reference the HTML files to ensure the README provides a comprehensive guide to navigating and understanding the project.

I will use the current repository's language, frameworks, and dependencies to ensure that the README.md file is in line with the existing codebase. I will also ensure that the file is well-structured, easy to read, and provides all the necessary information for anyone working on or using the project.

I will implement the code for creating the README.md file with precision and accuracy, ensuring that it is syntactically perfect and complete. I will pay close attention to detail and make sure that every function and class is fully implemented according to the plan of action.

By following the plan and implementing the code with care, I will ensure that the README.md file effectively communicates the purpose and functionality of the project, providing a valuable guide for navigating and understanding the codebase.
